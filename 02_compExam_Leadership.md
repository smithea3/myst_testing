## Leader-Member Exchange (LMX)
* Posited by Geroge Graen.
* Leaders form a *dyadic relationship* with their followers.
* According to this theory, leadership resides in the quality of the exchange relationship developed between leaders and their followers.
* Followers tend to get grouped into *in-groups* and *out-groups*. 

## Situational Leadership
* Developed by Hersey and Blanchard.
* Broken down into four styles depending on the need(s) of the follower(s).
  * **S1 (high directive—low supportive style; directing):** Focus is on communication of goals, but supportive behaviors are not needed.
  * **S2 (coaching):** Focus on high communication of goals as well as supporting the needs of the followers.
  * **S3 (supporting):** Not as focused on supportive behaviors, but uses supportive behaviors to bring out skills and accomplish goals.
  * **S4 (low supportive—low directive; delegating):** Does not provide much communication or supportive behavior (like a guide on the side).

## Transformational Leadership
* Arose from the classical work of James MacGregor Burnes (1978). 
* Leaders draw upon the motives of their followers to achieve the goals of the leaders and followers.
* Can result in positive psychological gains for the leader and the followers.
* The four "i"s of Transformational Leadership:
  * idealized influence
  * inspirational motivation
  * intellectual stimulation
  * individualized consideration
* Contrasted to transactional leadership

## Servant Leadership
* Developed by Robert Greenleaf.
* Places the needs of the follower above the needs of the leader.
* Behaviors of a Servant Leader
  * Conceptualization
  * Emotional healing
  * Putting followers first
  * Helping followers grow and succeed
  * Behaving ethically
  * Empowering
  * Creating value for the community
