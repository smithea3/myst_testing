# General Rules for Reporting Statistics
For information on the formal publication of the APA formatting of statistics, readers should reference [the APA style guide on statistics (link will take you away from the page)](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf).

# Reporting Mean and Standard Deviation
When reporting the mean and standard deviation, use the capital letters M for mean and SD for standard deviation. The M and SD should be italicized. 

:::{tip} Example
The scores of the Intelligence Quota examination were normally distributed (*M* = 100, *SD* = 15).
:::

# Percentages
When reporting percentages, the values shoujld be placed in parenthesis and rounded to the nearest whole percent.

:::{tip} Example
Nearly one-third of the population (34%) likes the color blue.

# Reporting Results of Hypothesis Testing
:::{note}
When reporting the *p* value, the following rules should be considered.
1. The *p* value should be reported to three decimal places. 
2. The decimal value should not have a leading zero. I.e., .023 is prefered over 0.023.
3. If the *p* values is less than .001, then the value should be reported as *p* < .001.
:::

## Univariate Linear Regression
When reporting a univariate lienar regression (i.e., $y=mx+b$), the results should be reported as *r*(df) = #, *p* = #.
