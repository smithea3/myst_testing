# General Rules for Reporting Statistics
For information on the formal publication of the APA formatting of statistics, readers should reference [the APA style guide on statistics (link will take you away from the page)](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf).

# Reporting Mean and Standard Deviation
When reporting the mean and standard deviation, use the capital letters M for mean and SD for standard deviation. The M and SD should be italicized. 

:::{tip} Example
The scores of the Intelligence Quota examination were normally distributed (*M* = 100, *SD* = 15).
:::

# Percentages
When reporting percentages, the values shoujld be placed in parenthesis and rounded to the nearest whole percent.

:::{tip} Example
Nearly one-third of the population (34%) likes the color blue.
:::

# Reporting Results of Hypothesis Testing
:::{note}
When reporting the *p* value, the following rules should be considered.
1. The *p* value should be reported to three decimal places. 
2. The decimal value should not have a leading zero. i.e., .023 is prefered over 0.023.
3. If the *p* values is less than .001, then the value should be reported as *p* < .001.
:::

## Univariate Linear Correlation
When reporting a univariate linear correlation (i.e., $y=mx+b$), the results should be reported as *r*(df) = #, *p* = #.

The degrees of freedom (df) is equal to the number of data points minus two—i.e., $n-2$.

:::{tip} Example
A linear correlation was calculation with ten data points and resulted in *r*(8) = .893, *p* = .023
:::

## Student t-Test
When reporting a Student *t*-test, the formation should be *t*(df) = #, *p* = #. 
* If the *t*-test is an independent sample *t*-test, then the degress of freedom (df) is calculated by adding the total number of observations and subtracting two. 
* If the *t*-test is a dependent sample (paired data) *t*-test, then the degrees of freedom (df) is the number of observations pair-wise groups minus one.

:::{tip} Example: Independent Sample *t*-test
A t-test was calculated to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the averages of two precalculus courses' final exam grades. The first class had 12 students and the second class had 15 students. The results were *t*(25) = 3.11, p < .001.
:::

:::{tip} Example: Dependent Sample *t*-test
A t-test was calculated to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between a pre-test and a post-test for a introductory biology class. class had 20 students. The results were *t*(19) = 2, p < .234.
